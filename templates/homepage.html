        Hello! My name is Spencer. Welcome to my website.
        <br></br>
        I'm a a physicist, data scientist, and lifelong learner.
        <br></br>
        I build tools which derive value from data-rich environemnts. My
        favorite area to work in is the financial sector becasue of the
        large, natural abundance of transactional data and the inherant challenge
        in working with probabilistic systems.
        <br></br>
        I've recently been more interested in modeling cryptocurrencies, but
        only time will tell how that hobby will end up.
        <br></br>
        I studdied physics at Skidmore College where I recieved a bachelors degree,
        and I studdied engineering and Management at Dartmouth College where I
        recieved a Bachelors of Engineering and a Masters of Management.
